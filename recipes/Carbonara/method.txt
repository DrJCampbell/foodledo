Chop the bacon into pieces and fry until not quite crispy.

Boil the spaghetti in salted water.

Mix the cream, egg yolks and most of the parmesan (save some to top the dish) in a jug.

When the spaghetti is cooked, reheat the bacon to crisp. Srain the pasta (retaining a little water) and return to the pan (off  the heat). Stir in the cream/cheese/egg mix and serve in a plate. Top with cripsy bacon and parmesan. Season with pepper.
