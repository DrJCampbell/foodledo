Preheat the oven to 180 Celcius. In an oven-proof pan, fry the bacon and rosemary (chopped) in a little oil. Add the onion and garlic and fry for three minutes.

Add the beef and brown, then add the red wine and allow to boil off a little. Add the oregano, tomatoes and tomato puree.

Cover with paper and cook in the oven for 1.5 hours. Towards the end of the time, cook the spaghetti in salted water.

Serve  the speghetti in a bowl, topped with bolognaise, grated parmesan and pepper.
