Chop the chicken into strips and marinade in the soy, ginger, garlic and wine for at least 30 mins in the fridge. Leaving for 3 hours would be better.
coat the strips in corn flour and leave to go brown
heat oil (hot) and fry for 3 mins on each side.

We one tried a double fry. Longer and cooler to cook through, Then a short and hot fry to crisp up.
